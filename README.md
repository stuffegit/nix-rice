some configs i use for arch, add picom to get pretty i3 transparency but be careful of ugly shadows around rounded corners

i3 docs:<br>
https://i3wm.org

tons of guides on how to make i3 pretty, i stole some ideas from:<br>
https://itsfoss.com/i3-customization/ (site might load slow?)

notable pkgs:<br>
i3-wm, i3blocks, i3lock-color, i3status, 
feh, lxappearance, rofi/drun(or dmenu if u wish), rxvt-unicode, zsh, oh-my-zsh.
